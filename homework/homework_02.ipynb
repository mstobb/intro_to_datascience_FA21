    "In class and in the readings, we examined structured and unstructured data.  We said that structured data most often can be imagined as a spreadsheet - or a table - with clear relationships between rows and columns.  Unstructured data, on the other hand, does not have these clear relationships.  Finally, we mentioned semi-structured data, which is a mix of the two.  In a few sentences, describe why semi-structured data is not regarded as \"structured\" in the classical sense and yet it is still used extensively for communicating information.\n",
