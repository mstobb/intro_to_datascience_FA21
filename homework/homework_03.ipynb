    "In class we discussed the methods and use of various Image Classification systems.  One extension of these systems is the so-called Deepfake video and audio, where image recognition is used, at least in part, to create new images or videos with artificially generated faces and voices.  One simple example of this is the website [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/), which randomly creates a high resolution, photo-realistic human face every time the website reloads.\n",

For example, if I flipped my coin and rolled my dice and got a Tails and 4, then I would have a total of 4 points.\n",

Modify the code below to simulate the random process described in Question 3.  Then make plots to show the resulting distribution (see class notes on Moodle for examples).  Does it match with your intuition?"
