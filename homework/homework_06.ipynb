In the United States at least, Facebook did not do anything illegal; it just provided information (perhaps more information that they intended) to a licensed third party.  If Facebook did not do anything illegal, why do you think it made such headlines?  In a few sentences, discuss why you believe this was such an important story."

A natural conclusion might be that we should *regulate* Facebook somehow, to control how it operates and works.  Read the article \"*How Should We Limit Facebookâ€™s Power?*\" on Moodle, then in a few sentences give your opinion.  Specificially, should we regulate Facebook?  If so, what do you think is the best way?"
