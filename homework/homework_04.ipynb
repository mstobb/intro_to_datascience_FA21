    "In class we discussed how matchmaking systems and dating applications are using machine learning to better match people, fix typos in bios, and identify fake accounts, among other things.  Moreover, we discussed Tinder's past use of Elo ratings, which assigned each user a *desirability rating*, and then showed matched based on this score. Are there any ethical problems with such a system?  Do you see anything right or wrong with it?  In a few sentences, explain your own point of view."

    "The software tool OpenRefine was demonstrated and discussed in class. It was presented as an alternative method for initially cleaning a data set, but that any actual analysis would need to be preformed somewhere else.  Thus if one were to use a tool like OpenRefine, they would have to use at least **two** different tools: OpenRefine and something else.  From what you have seen and experienced so far in the class, is this extra work (moving between different tool sets) worth it?  In a few sentences, discuss your position, using an analogy from something you are more familiar with as an example."
