### Dating Apps

- Tinder originally used ELO scores
  - Each person was a "player"
  - When they 'liked' a person, they lost, transferring some of their score to the other
  - Elo scores are used for LOTS of different systems
    - Chess
    - Board Games - Backgammon
    - Card Games - MTG
    - Online Games - PUBG
    - Athletic sports - Tennis
    - OG Facebook
  - Elo scores naturally separate players into different skill levels
    - The system is self correcting
      - People rated too high or low will be fixed eventually
    - Tinder used it to separate people into different "desirability" levels
      - Then would show you people inside YOUR level
- Tinder no longer uses Elo scores, now uses a recommender system
  - This makes it much more like most traditional dating apps
  - Finding what makes a great relationship is hard, and it seems machines have not cracked it
- Cognitive overload and the paralysis of choice
  - Too many choices can keep us from ever choosing anything
  - The sweet spot is probably 8 to 15 choices.
  - Too few and we feel cheated; too many and we're overwhelmed.
    - "The idea is that the best out of 12 is probably rather good, while the jump to the best out of 24 is not a big improvement,"
    - While dating, people can fall into the trap of the "[paradox of choice](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-paradox-of-choice-could-explain-why-youre-still-single-2018-2?r=US&IR=T)," where they obsess over little things they don't like about their partner, and constantly feel there's someone out there who's better. Essentially, it's the "grass is always greener" mindset. But if you're always looking out for someone more perfect, you're likely to miss out on something great.
