# More on Data

## Some Motivation

- Why should we care about data?

  - **Data can be used to help us answer questions about the world**

- Fundamental to data science is an innate, insatiable ***curiosity***

  > The Internet Movie Database (IMDb)
  > Everybody loves the movies. The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) provides
  > crowdsourced and curated data about all aspects of the motion picture industry,
  > at www.imdb.com. IMDb currently contains data on over 3.3 million movies and
  > TV programs. For each film, IMDb includes its title, running time, genres, date
  > of release, and a full list of cast and crew. There is financial data about each
  > production, including the budget for making the film and how well it did at the
  > box office.
  > Finally, there are extensive ratings for each film from viewers and critics.
  > This rating data consists of scores on a zero to ten stars scale, cross-tabulated
  > into averages by age and gender. Written reviews are often included, explaining
  > why a particular critic awarded a given number of stars. There are also links
  > between films: for example, identifying which other films have been watched
  > most often by viewers of It’s a Wonderful Life.
  > Every actor, director, producer, and crew member associated with a film
  > merits an entry in IMDb, which now contains records on 6.5 million people.
  >
  > These happen to include my brother, cousin, and sister-in-law. Each actor
  > is linked to every film they appeared in, with a description of their role and
  > their ordering in the credits. Available data about each personality includes
  > birth/death dates, height, awards, and family relations.
  >
  > Perhaps the most natural questions to ask IMDb involve identifying the
  > extremes of movies and actors:
  > • Which actors appeared in the most films? Earned the most money? Ap-
  > peared in the lowest rated films? Had the longest career or the shortest
  > lifespan?
  > • What was the highest rated film each year, or the best in each genre?
  > Which movies lost the most money, had the highest-powered casts, or got
  > the least favorable reviews.
  > Then there are larger-scale questions one can ask about the nature of the
  > motion picture business itself:
  > • How well does movie gross correlate with viewer ratings or awards? Do
  > customers instinctively flock to trash, or is virtue on the part of the cre-
  > ative team properly rewarded?
  > • How do Hollywood movies compare to Bollywood movies, in terms of rat-
  > ings, budget, and gross? Are American movies better received than foreign
  > films, and how does this differ between U.S. and non-U.S. reviewers?
  > • What is the age distribution of actors and actresses in films? How much
  > younger is the actress playing the wife, on average, than the actor playing
  > the husband? Has this disparity been increasing or decreasing with time?
  > • Live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse? Do movie stars live
  > longer or shorter lives than bit players, or compared to the general public?
  >
  > - What does the social network of actors look like?
  > - Not to mention, movie recommendations and predictions!
