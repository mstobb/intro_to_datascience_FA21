# Structured vs. Unstructured Data

## Structured Data

- Information that has consistent, internal, and identifiable structure
- Some individual data items have structure:
  - Dates: YYYY/MM/DD
  - Phone Numbers: (XXX) XXX - XXXX
  - Zip Codes: XXXXX
  - Demographic Information: 
  - ISBN on Books: 10 Digit Structure
  - Names: FirstName, MiddleName, LastName
    - Assumes western cultural standards
- But that's not the real story behind "structured data"
- Structured data almost always looks like a spreadsheet
  - Show Rotten Tomatoes Example
  - Rows are "Records", Columns are "Fields"
  - All the fields for a record are related TO THAT RECORD
    - This feature is what really defines structured data!



## Unstructured Data

- No overarching structure to the data set
  - We have no notion of "records" or "fields"
    - Log files
    - Multimedia files (movies, audio files)
    - Chat histories
    - Emails
    - Raw Text files



## Semi-Structured Data

- Data is organized in a hierarchy with key-value pairs
  - Parts: 
    - 1: "washer"
    - 2: "screw"
    - 3: "nail"
      - short
      - medium
      - long
    - 4: "bracket"
- Much of the Internet uses semi-structured data
  - All websites (using html) are a form of semi-structured data
